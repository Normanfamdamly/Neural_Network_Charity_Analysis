# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis- Module 19 Challenge
---
Nerual Network model the optimizing of the data.

## Overview 
---
Utilizing my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks we will take the data provided to us from Alphabet Soups team, and create a predition as to those applicants most likely to be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. We will do those through cleaning the data and testing the data in multiple ways to get as close as we can to an accurancy of 75%.

## Results

# Data Preprocessing

    - What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
        -- Any of the loans that are marked as "Is Successful" is a target of the model as they are the funded loans
        
    - What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model 
        -- The column "Is Successful is the feature for this model
        
    - What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
        -- The variable that could be removed are "Ein and Name" as they do not add any help or accurancy to the model.

# Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

    - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
        -- I started with 80, 30 and 1 with 2 layers. Then tried to optimized to 100, 80, 60, 40 but could not get any better than 
           an accurancy of 72.63%

    - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
        -- I was not able to achieve a 75% accuracy. I could only get to 72.63%.
        
    - What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
